# GitHub actions

This is where all of the configuration files for [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) live. They contain the tasks necessary for continuous integration testing. If there are tests, lints, or other tasks that ought to be performed client-side (e.g., on your local computer, before or after pushing to the repository), add them to the [.githooks folder](https://github.com/toybox-rs/toybox-rs/tree/main/.githooks).
